Annotation tool for labeling retinal fundus images. Bounding box annotations get saved as .txt files in the same input dir.

All classes are specific to diabetic retinopathy grading:
- Microaneurysms
- Optic disc
- Macula
- Hemorrhages
- Exudates
- Cotton wool spots
- Others

Built this because I needed something lightweight that runs on Python alone. Existing tools were bloated and didn't let me define my own classes easily.
